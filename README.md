# gamehaggwchecker
Gamehag giveaway checker (spaghetti code). To install the userscript, go into the .js file, and click the "Raw" button on the top of the script. Try running it from /giveaway/309 to begin (it automatically starts).

If you don't want to skip giveaways you have already completed, change the line "var skipCompleted = 1;" into "var skipCompleted = 0;". It will then stop at every possibly functional giveaway even if you have already completed it. It can be hard for you to verify if it is 100% functional, but if the key is still visible then there is a high chance that others will be able to complete it as well.
