# Gamehag giveaway checker
Gamehag giveaway checker (spaghetti code). To install the userscript, go into the .js file, and click the "Raw" button on the top of the script. Try running it from /giveaway/309 to begin (it automatically starts).

If you don't want to skip giveaways you have already completed, change the line "var skipCompleted = 1;" into "var skipCompleted = 0;". It will then stop at every possibly functional giveaway even if you have already completed it. It can be hard for you to verify if it is 100% functional, but if the key is still visible then there is a high chance that others will be able to complete it as well.

It's very hard to keep track of what links in the Deals or the itch.io free games thread you have already opened. This script makes every link you have already opened a very bright red color, so that you can be sure that the itch.io claimable game you see linked is something you don't already own. It's not pretty, but it works.
